# Algorithms Practice

## Synopsis

This is a personal project that contains the solutions to a few interesting problems that are collected from various sources. All credits for the problems belong to the original authors and care has been taken to refer to the original source of the problem in the source file of the solution. 

## Motivation

While the theoretical underpinnings of Algorithm Design are fun, I found implementing those algorithms in code even more so. This repository mainly exists to allow me the flexibility to work from various machines. However, as a side-effect, if it helps anyone searching for a solution to a similar problem, that would truly serve the purpose of this repository. 

## Installation

It is a maven project. You can check it out in your favorite editor and start hacking.

## Tests

I have tried to adopt Test-Driven Design. Almost all the solutions are accompanied by their unit tests written using TestNg (JUnit).

## Contributors

All solutions are correct to the best of my knowledge. However, the quality of code may vary depending on how recently I solved the problems. Please feel free to raise an issue whenever a bug is found and correct it.
